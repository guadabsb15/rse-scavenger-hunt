# RSE Scavenger Hunt

![magnifying glass with path](images/Lupe_JulichBlue1,2_KeyVisual_R_path.svg)

This project provides a framework for practicing some of the skills that RSEs would find useful. The idea comes from a scavenger hunt game, and it gives reference to valuable lessons developed by the community.

You can follow work on the exercises at your own pace, and on the exercises that you feel interested in doing. At the same time, you will receive instantaneous feedback.  

We will guide you through the project and the steps to get started!


## What is a scavenger hunt?

A [scavenger hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger_hunt) is a game with a list of items to be collected, and the goal is to collect as many items as possible. In our approach, we have a list of exercises which help practicing various skills. Everytime you successfully finish an exercise, a score board will be updated with tokens (:star2:) corresponding to those skills.
